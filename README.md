# benchmarks

Set of latency benchmarks testing round trip time (RTT) between threads or processes via FIFO data structures.

To run the benchmarks execute the Gradle script in the base directory.

    $ ./gradlew
    $ ./gradlew runJavaBenchmarks

## C++ Benchmarks

To generate the benchmarks, execute the `cppbuild` script from the base directory.

    $ cppbuild/cppbuild

To run the benchmarks, execute the individual benchmarks.

    $ cppbuild/Release/binaries/baseline
    $ cppbuild/Release/binaries/aeronExclusiveIpcBenchmark
    $ cppbuild/Release/binaries/aeronIpcBenchmark

__NOTE__: On MacOS, it will be necessary to set `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` for the Aeron
driver shared library. For example:

    $ env DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=cppbuild/Release/aeron-prefix/src/aeron-build/lib cppbuild/Release/binaries/aeronIpcBenchmark
